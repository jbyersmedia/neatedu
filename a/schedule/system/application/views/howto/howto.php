 	<p><img src="images/howto/ScreenOn.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	<p>If the system is off, press <strong> &lsquo;System On&rsquo;</strong> which is located on the left side of the touch screen. <em>Note: Also make sure TVs are &lsquo;ON&rsquo;.</em></p>

	<p><img src="images/howto/ScreenStart.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	<p>Once you have done that you will see <strong> &lsquo;Touch to Start&rsquo;</strong> on the touch screen. You will need to push that to get the controls up on the touch screen. </p>
	
	<p>In the <em>upper left </em>of the touch screen you should see the <strong> &lsquo;Local Sources&rsquo;</strong> section. These are the choices you have for the video displays you wish to show to the remote site and also what you wish to show on your local display. The choices are described below. </p>
	<p><img src="images/howto/ScreenSources.jpg" width="500" height="375" /> </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><strong> Student Camera</strong> ~ this will be a view of the class room </li>
	<li><strong> Instructor Camera</strong> ~ this will be a view of the podium or front of the room. </li>
	<li><strong> Document Camera</strong> ~ this is often called the <em>&lsquo;Pad Camera&rsquo;</em> or <em>&lsquo;Elmo&rsquo;</em>. Basically it&rsquo;s an overhead that displays on a TV instead of a screen. </li>
	<li><strong> VCR</strong><strong></strong> ~ this will display the VCR or DVD player if present. </li>
	<li><strong> PC Presenter</strong> ~ this will display what the PC is displaying if one is connected. <em>Note: if using a PC be sure you know how to change the display and keep in mind a PC does not look that good on a TV as compared to a VGA/XGA monitor.</em></li>
	<li><strong> Slides</strong> ~ this will display the slide projector option. You will need to press the <strong>&lsquo;More&rsquo;</strong> arrow to reach this choice. </li>
	</ul>

	<p><img src="images/howto/ScreenDisplay.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	<p>In the <em>lower left</em> of the touch screen, you will see the <strong> &lsquo;Display&rsquo; </strong>section. The choices here are &lsquo; Remote&rsquo; and &lsquo; Local or Self view&rsquo;. These two buttons will change what video you see on the touch screen from either local video source view to remote site view. You can also change the remote TV to local by pressing self view when in a call, not that you would want to but if you do you would have to press it again to undo.</p>

	<p><em> A note on the current display on the touch screen: if you press the picture in the center of the touch screen it will go to full screen. You will lose all buttons until you press the screen again and then press &lsquo;Exit&rsquo; on the lower left. </em></p>
	<p><img src="images/howto/ScreenButtons.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	<p>The buttons around the touch screen are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong> System On</strong> ~ turns the equipment &lsquo;ON&rsquo; </li>
	<li><strong> System Off</strong> ~ turns equipment &lsquo;OFF&rsquo; </li>
	<li><strong> Volume</strong> ~ controls what you hear, not what the other site hears </li>
	<li><strong> Mute</strong> ~ disables all microphones in your room </li>
	<li><strong> System Setup</strong> ~ system controls that are password protected </li>
	<li><strong> Call Status Control</strong> ~ from here you can make a call or hang up a call. <em>Not recommended without further training</em>. </li>
	<li><strong> Far End Control</strong> ~ if in a point to point call without the use of a MCU, one would be able to control the remote sites cameras. This is rarely used because it only works between two sites that are connected directly to each other. </li>
	<li><strong> Multi-Point</strong><strong> Control</strong> ~ this is for systems that have integrated MCU capabilities. <em>Not recommended without further training and supportive network. </em> &nbsp;</li>
	</ul>

	<p><img src="images/howto/ScreenControls.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	<p>In the <em>bottom center</em> of the touch screen you will see controls for currently selected Local Source if that source can be controlled from the touch screen. For the cameras it is basic pan, tilt, and zoom functions. </p>
	<p>In the <em>right</em> of the touch screen is for <strong> camera presets</strong> when a camera is selected. To preset a camera position press <strong> &lsquo;Save Preset&rsquo;</strong> then press the preset number you wish to save it to. You can also rename it by pressing <strong> &lsquo;Change Name&rsquo;</strong>. </p>
	<p>When <strong>VCR</strong> is selected it is recording options, which are: <img src="images/howto/ScreenVCR.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Incoming</strong> ~ to record the incoming video from the remote site </li>
	<li><strong>Outgoing</strong> ~ to record the video going out to a remote site which is whatever you have selected from the Local Source section.</li>
	<li><strong>Voiced Switched</strong> ~ switches between in and out going video dependant upon which ever is loudest.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When you are done using the system you need to press <strong> &lsquo;System Off&rsquo;. </strong>You will be given a choice of <strong> &lsquo;Do Not Disturb&rsquo;</strong> Yes or No. <strong>CHOOSE NO </strong></p>
